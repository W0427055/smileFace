# smileFace
## Wifi-Hacking Tool
Works best on debian based systems as the default names for devices are wlan0, eth0, etc.

You will also need an ngrok code from myself to complete the install or you can make your own index.html and captive portal, just make sure you follow the directories in the script.

The zeroTier script is for my own lazy purposes.

Usage:
    cd smileFace
    Chmod +x smileFace.sh
    ./smileFace.sh
