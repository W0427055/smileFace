## Wifi-Hacking Tool

Educational use only, only test on networks you own or have CONSENT to work on.

Works best on debian based systems as the default names for devices are wlan0, eth0, etc.
If you know how to change the device names to the above examples the script will run perfectly, at this time the script will not do it for you.

You will also need an ngrok code from me to complete the install or you can make your own index.html and captive portal, just make sure you follow the directories in the script.

The zeroTier script is for my own lazy purposes.

You will need a wifi-adapter capable of monitor mode and packet injection, I will be adding ways for the script to check this in the future.

Usage:\
cd smileFace\
Chmod +x smileFace.sh\
./smileFace.sh
